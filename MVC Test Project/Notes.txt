Notes Regarding Project:

   1. Length of time: about 10hrs (3 of which were solving membership config problems and trying to get SqlCe to work with ASP membership).

   2. In a real world app I would have used more than just one entity such as: User, Role, UserRoles, Image, ImageStatistics.

   3. I used a seperate class for logging in to the database so that I did not have to include Password field with the User entity.
